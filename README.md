Traffic Accident Prediction Project

Project Overview

This project predicts traffic accidents based on real factors like weather, road conditions, time of day, vehicle types, and more, using machine learning methods. It aims to forecast accident occurrence and severity to enhance road safety and reduce accident impact.

Features

Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis with Pandas and Seaborn.

Visualization of accident patterns and key risk factors.

Encoding of categorical variables for ML modeling.

Training of machine learning models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

Evaluation using classification report, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance.

Dataset

The dataset includes diverse features such as:

Weather conditions

Road characteristics (type, conditions)

Time-related factors (hour, day)

Vehicle types involved

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Random Forest and Logistic Regression models for classification

How to Use

Clone this repository.

Load and clean the dataset provided (dataset_traffic_accident_prediction1.csv).
